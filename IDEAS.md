# Ideas
1. Make this my own clonable IDE just like NvChad or LazyVim
2. Make it so that the idea has support for almost any language servers with LSP files that can be imported depending on current work
3. Write the install.lua file to make it installable in one click even if the user does not have Vim, Python or NPM installed.
4. Call the project VimJu
5. Make it so that the terminal settings can be configured from a command so that you can switch between appropiate background for each theme.
6. Write the VimJu themes
